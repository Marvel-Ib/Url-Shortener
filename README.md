# Url-Shortner

Node.js app made with Express and Semantic ui  

### I challenged myself with this and had three main features 
### I had no idea on how to implement before hand but it turned out great and I was able to learn a lot 
### the three main features were

* The user should be able to copy the url after it had been shortened

* Check while the user was still typing whether the shortened url had been taken by a previous user

* Send the shortened url to the user email once the user was done
